This week, we'll have an interactive personal branding workshop led by our very own Ophelia Ding. The workshop will walk you through defining your values and passions all the way to writing your personal brand statement. After your personal brand statement is created, you'll learn about how your personal brand can manifest itself in different aspects of your website, blog or LinkedIn profile.
