excerpt: Learn from our board members how to best use your summer!

Summer is right around the corner and weâ€™ve asked some of our board members to conduct a panel discussion to answer your questions and talk about how they try to make the best of their summer with or without an internship! 

Afterwards, join us to play board games and study together at HSS. You are more than welcome to bring a game or two :)
