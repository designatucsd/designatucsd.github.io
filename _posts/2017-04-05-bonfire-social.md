Start the quarter off right and come out to our bonfire this Wednesday for s’mores and good company!  New members are absolutely invited to learn more about our organization and meet some of our current members.  Please feel free to bring volleyballs, beach balls, frisbees, etc. and be sure to dress warmly!

We plan to start shuttling people from Sun God Lawn around 6PM but public transit is also an option.  Please fill out the following form if you need a ride or can give a ride: https://goo.gl/forms/wnBdt8DeaT1ca5nF3
