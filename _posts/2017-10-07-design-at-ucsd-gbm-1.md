excerpt: Design at UCSD is an open community of designers looking to educate, inspire
  and involve students across disciplines. Whether you’re a freshman starting college
  or a continuing student returning from summer break, everyone’s invited to come
  hang out with us at our first GBM for this year!   If you’re interested in learning
  more about design, what we do or how you could get involved with Design at UCSD,
  then this is the event for you. We will also be going through our upcoming industry
  focused events and our mentorship program for the year.   We look forward to seeing
  you and kicking off the school year together!
