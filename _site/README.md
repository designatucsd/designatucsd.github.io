# Design at UCSD Website
The website for Design at UCSD. See [designatucsd.org](http://designatucsd.org).

## Development

### How to set up:
First, clone this repo and `cd` into the directory.

```
$ gem install jekyll
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Now view the site at `http://localhost:4000`.

*Note*: If you're running OSX El Capitan (like me), you may have to install the latest version of XCode by running `$ xcode-select --install` or from the Mac App Store.
